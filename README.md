## What I recommend adding to make this profile stand out
- A high-quality profile photo and a short, polished bio (one-line elevator pitch).
- Pin 4–6 standout repositories (projects with polished READMEs, demos, tests).
- Add a Projects or Portfolio section with screenshots and live demos.
- Create a downloadable resume (PDF) in the repo and link it prominently.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md and issue/PR templates to invite collaborators.
- Add GitHub Actions for linting/tests and a deploy pipeline for demos.
- Use badges (build, coverage, license) on project READMEs.
- Keep README concise and use real links/screenshots — replace placeholders.

---

If you’d like, I can produce ready-to-commit files for:
- A polished profile README (this file — replace placeholders with your real links)
- CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE, and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
- A minimal GitHub Actions workflow to run lint/tests for JavaScript/TypeScript projects

Replace the placeholders above (portfolio URL, email, project links) with your real links and I’ll convert them into ready-to-commit files.
